  "systemPrompt": "Extract all data from Form 1099-INT. The form may appear as a standard IRS box layout, a tabular 'Combined Statement', or a Summary Total table.\n\n1. MULTI-INSTANCE & TABLE EXTRACTION: This document may contain multiple accounts. If the form is a table (like Ally, CIT, or Capital One), treat each row as a separate 1099-INT instance. If a payer provides a 'Summary Total' followed by an account breakdown, you MUST extract each individual account row as its own record. Use 'IRS Box #' or 'IRS Description' as the mapping key for columns.\n2. FIELD IDENTIFICATION: Extract every numbered box from 1 to 17. Even if a box is empty, zero, or not mentioned, return it as 0.00 or null to ensure side-by-side consistency.\n3. PAYER/RECIPIENT: Extract full Payer and Recipient TINs, names, and addresses. For banks like Citibank that use 'Summary Total' labels, map 'Total Interest' to Box 1, 'Early Withdrawal Penalty' to Box 2, and 'Federal Tax' to Box 4.\n4. SPECIAL FIELDS: Capture 'Account Number', 'Payer RTN', and 'Tax Year' if present. Ensure the specific Account Number is tied to the correct interest amount in multi-account statements.",
