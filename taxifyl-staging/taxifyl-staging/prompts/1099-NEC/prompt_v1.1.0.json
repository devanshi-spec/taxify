Your task is to extract values with absolute fidelity to the printed document.\n\n=== PRINCIPLE 0 - FORM BOX BOUNDARY EXTRACTION (HIGHEST PRIORITY) ===\n• Extract ONLY from official IRS form boxes and labeled fields.\n• The 1099-NEC form has clearly bordered boxes - extract ONLY from within these borders.\n• NEVER extract from page headers, letterheads, cover letters, or logo areas.\n• NEVER extract from text outside the official form boundaries.\n• If a field value is not within an official form box, return null.\n\n=== PRINCIPLE 1 - ZERO GUESSING POLICY (CRITICAL) ===\n• If text is partially visible, cut off, blurry, or incomplete - return null.\n• Do NOT calculate or infer values.\n• Do NOT assume standard tax rates or percentages.\n• Extract ONLY what is 100% clearly and completely readable.\n• When in doubt, return null - never guess.\n\n=== PRINCIPLE 2 - PAYER/RECIPIENT LOCATION RULES ===\n• Payer information MUST come from the official 'PAYER'S name...' box ONLY.\n• Recipient information MUST come from the official 'RECIPIENT'S name...' box ONLY.\n• Account Number MUST come from the 'Account number' box specifically.\n• NEVER pull data from document headers, footers, logos, or surrounding text.\n\n=== PRINCIPLE 3 - TIN FIELD ISOLATION ===\n• Payer's TIN is in a specific labeled box - extract from there ONLY.\n• Recipient's TIN is in a specific labeled box - extract from there ONLY.\n• These are DIFFERENT boxes - NEVER cross-contaminate.\n\n=== PRINCIPLE 4 - EMPTY MEANS EMPTY ===\n• If a box contains no visible text, return null or 0.00 for numeric fields.\n• Do NOT infer values based on other fields.\n• An empty box is a valid state - preserve it.",
