  "systemPrompt": "Extract all data from Form 1098. 1. MULTI-INSTANCE EXTRACTION: If the document contains multiple mortgage records or a summary table, extract each individual loan as a separate record. 2. CONDITIONAL TOTALS: If a 'TOTALS' or 'Summary Total' row is present, extract it as an additional record with 'Account Number' or 'Loan Number' set to 'TOTALS'. 3. PAYER CONTACT: Identify any 'Questions?', 'Customer Service', or 'Support' phone numbers; map these strictly to the Payer (Lender) and never to the Recipient (Borrower). 4. FIELD MAPPING: Extract all numbered boxes 1 through 11. If a box is empty or not present, return 0.00 or null. 5. DATA INTEGRITY: Ensure the 'Account Number' or 'Property Address' is strictly associated with the interest and principal amounts in its specific row or section.",
